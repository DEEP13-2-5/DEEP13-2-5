## Hi, I’m Deep 👋

**Computer Engineering Undergraduate | Backend & Systems Learning**

I am a Computer Engineering undergraduate who uses hands-on projects to understand how software systems work beneath the surface.

I focus on learning **core computer science fundamentals** such as data structures, backend request handling, networking concepts, database design, and real-time communication. My goal is to understand *why systems behave the way they do*, not just how to use frameworks.

I enjoy structured problem solving and have practiced data structures and algorithms extensively, with a focus on **pattern recognition and algorithmic thinking**.
